## 👋 About My Business

I'm **Anthony G.**, the founder and sole operator of this cybersecurity service. I started this business with a clear mission: to protect the digital lives of small businesses and families—the very people often overlooked by large cybersecurity firms.

My approach is built on **"Purple Team" thinking**. I study the tools and techniques used by attackers in order to build practical, robust defenses against real-world threats. I don't just install software; I secure your network from the inside out.
