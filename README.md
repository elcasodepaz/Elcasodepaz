👋 About Me

Hey, I’m ElCaso Depaz, a self-taught cybersecurity practitioner with hands-on experience in building and breaking systems from the ground up. I blend the mindset of a fighter with the discipline of a defender.

🥊 By day, I study threats.
💻 By night, I simulate and detect them.

I’m currently focused on building a Purple Team cybersecurity portfolio to earn my first job in the field. Everything you see here is real lab work, built from my own gear, grind, and curiosity.
