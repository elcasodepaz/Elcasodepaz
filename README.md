## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm **ElCaso Depaz**, an aspiring cybersecurity analyst with a strong focus on detection engineering, attack simulation, and security operations.  
After completing the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate**, I began building hands-on labs to sharpen my skills and document my journey into the field.

I specialize in **Purple Team operations** — understanding how attackers think, and creating systems to detect and stop them. This GitHub showcases that path.
