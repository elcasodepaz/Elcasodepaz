## üëã Welcome to Nj cyber safety

My name is **Anthony G.**, and I'm the founder of **Nj cyber safety**. I provide robust cybersecurity solutions by demonstrating and defending against the very techniques used by malicious actors.

This GitHub profile is more than a resume‚Äîit's a living showcase of my work. Here, you'll find repositories demonstrating simulated attacks on homes and small businesses. My goal is to pull back the curtain on cybersecurity, show you the real threats, and provide advanced protection that is both effective and affordable.

## üõ°Ô∏è Our Services

We believe advanced security shouldn't come with an enterprise price tag. We offer a range of services tailored to your specific needs.

### Core Protection (For Small Businesses & Families)
| Service | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Network & Router Hardening** | I'll secure the digital front door to your home or business. This service hardens your router, Wi-Fi, and network settings to block intruders and prevent unauthorized access. |
| **Cybersecurity Health Check** | Think of this as a friendly penetration test. I'll scan your network and devices for common weaknesses that hackers exploit and provide a clear plan to fix them. |
| **Hacker & Scam Awareness** | Knowledge is your best defense. I provide practical training on how to spot phishing emails, avoid common scams, and keep your personal information safe online. |

### Advanced Security Operations
| Service | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Drone-Based Reconnaissance** | Using advanced aerial surveillance, I can assess your physical security and wireless network footprint from a unique perspective, identifying vulnerabilities that are invisible from the ground. |
| **Advanced Red Team Ops** | For businesses needing to test their defenses, I conduct comprehensive adversarial simulations, modeling the behavior of advanced persistent threats (APTs) to find and fix gaps in your security. |

## üëæ Showcasing Our Techniques: GitHub Repositories

I believe in transparency. These repositories (both current and planned) are designed to demonstrate the real-world threats you face and the techniques I use to combat them.

| Repository / Project Idea | Purpose & Demonstration |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`Home-Network-Attack-Sim`** | Shows how attackers scan for and exploit common misconfigurations in home routers and smart devices (IoT). |
| **`Small-Business-Phishing-Demo`** | A simulation of a targeted phishing campaign using fake invoices to show how easily an employee click can lead to a network-wide breach. |
| **`Public-WiFi-Sniffing-Attack`** | Demonstrates how hackers can intercept unencrypted data on public Wi-Fi (cafes, airports) and how to protect yourself with VPNs. |
| **`Drone-Recon-Wireless-Assessment`** | A proof-of-concept showing how a drone can be used to map Wi-Fi signal strength and identify rogue access points from the air. |
| **`[IN PROGRESS] Ransomware-Sim`** | A controlled simulation to show the speed and impact of a ransomware attack and test detection/response procedures. |
